# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description
This weeks assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
```

## Installation & Usage & Tests
The first thing to do is to clone the [Starter Code Repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).

Type `npm init` in the terminal to get `package.json`.

Type `npm install express` in the terminal to install dependencies for the project.

Type `npm start` to initiate the server.

Note that there is no testing for this project!

## Project Demo

## Heroku Deployed Link
I was unable to use heroku even after all directions were followed and installation was a success. 

## Final Thoughts
This module was very difficult for me to grasp. I watched the Express.js tutorial video I went back and watched the zoom session. I also studied and reviewed my notes I made from class to understand th different express methods and get a better grasp of the syntax for setting up the server such as get() and post(). In this project back-end web application framework was a little difficult for me.  I know with practice and repitition I will understand it. I will add the delete functionality in the future. I was supposed to use Heroku - a platform service that allows developers to build, run, and operate applications on the cloud server but I could not get it to work in my terminal. All directions were followed and installation was a success.
